# Push Notifications Setup with PushEngage

This React application has been set up to work with PushEngage push notifications. Follow these steps to complete the integration:

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

1. **Service Worker**: Created `/public/service-worker.js` with PushEngage SDK
2. **Service Worker Registration**: Automatically registers when the app loads
3. **UI Component**: Built a React component to handle notification permissions
4. **Modern Design**: Beautiful, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. PushEngage Account Setup

1. Sign up for a PushEngage account at https://www.pushengage.com/
2. Create a new site/project in your PushEngage dashboard
3. Get your site key and configuration details

### 2. Configure PushEngage

You'll need to add PushEngage configuration to your application. Create a new file `src/lib/pushengage-config.ts`:

```typescript
export const pushEngageConfig = {
  siteKey: "YOUR_SITE_KEY_HERE", // Replace with your actual site key
  // Add other configuration options as needed
};
```

### 3. Domain Configuration

Based on the instructions you received:

- **Main Domain**: Host this application on your main domain or subdomain
- **Custom Sub Domain**: If using a custom subdomain for HTTPS, configure it in your PushEngage dashboard
- **Service Worker Path**: The service worker is already placed at `/public/service-worker.js` and will be accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/service-worker.js`

### 4. HTTPS Requirement

Push notifications require HTTPS. Make sure your application is served over HTTPS in production.

### 5. Testing

1. Run the application: `npm run dev` or `bun run dev`
2. Open the application in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Click "Enable Notifications" to test the permission request
4. Check the browser's developer console for any errors
